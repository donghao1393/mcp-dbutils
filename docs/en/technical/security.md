# Security Architecture

## Communication Pattern and Security Architecture

MCP Database Utilities implements a secure communication pattern designed to protect your data at every step. The following diagram illustrates how data flows between components while maintaining security:

    subgraph User["User Environment"]
        Client["AI Client<br>(Claude/Cursor)"]
        ConfigFile["Configuration File<br>(YAML)"]
    end

    subgraph MCP["MCP Database Utilities"]
        MCPService["MCP Service"]
        ConnectionManager["Connection Manager"]
        QueryProcessor["Query Processor<br>(Read-only)"]
    end

    subgraph Databases["Database Layer"]
        DB1["Database 1"]
        DB2["Database 2"]
        DBn["Database n"]
    end

## Core Security Features

1. **Isolated Access Flow**:
   - Your AI client never directly accesses your databases
   - All requests pass through the controlled MCP service environment

2. **Temporary Connections**:
   - Database connections are established only when needed
   - Connections are closed immediately after query execution
   - No persistent connections that could be exploited

3. **Read-Only Operations**:
   - Query processor enforces strict SELECT-only operations
   - No possibility of data modification (no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

4. **Configuration Separation**:
   - Connection details are isolated in a separate configuration file
   - Credentials are never exposed to the AI model

5. **Multi-Database Support**:
   - Each database connection is managed separately
   - Databases are isolated from each other through the connection manager

This architecture ensures that even if you use the tool for multiple databases or purposes, each connection remains secure and isolated, minimizing data exposure.

## Troubleshooting Guide

When using MCP Database Utilities, you may encounter the following common issues. Here's a guide to diagnosing and resolving these problems.

### Connection Issues

1. **Unable to Connect to Database**
   - Confirm that your connection information in the configuration file is correct
   - Verify that your database server is running and accessible
   - Check if network firewalls allow the connection
   - For remote databases, confirm that hostname/IP address and port are correct

2. **Configuration File Errors**
   - Check YAML syntax is correct (indentation, colons, etc.)
   - Confirm all required fields are provided
   - Verify file paths are correct (especially for SQLite database files)

3. **Permission Issues**
   - Ensure the provided database user has SELECT permissions
   - Check if the user can access the required tables and views
   - For SQLite, verify file system permissions allow reading

### Logging and Diagnostics

For advanced troubleshooting, you can enable verbose logging:

#### Command Line Debug Enabling

```bash
# Enable verbose logging
MCP_DEBUG=1 uvx mcp-dbutils --config your_config.yaml
```

#### MCP Client Configuration Debug Enabling

Add environment variables in MCP configuration:

**JSON Configuration Example**:
```json
{
  "dbutils": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
      "mcp-dbutils",
      "--config",
      "/path/to/your/config.yaml"
    ],
    "env": {
      "MCP_DEBUG": "1"
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor MCP Configuration**:
Add environment variables in Cursor Settings → MCP → Edit Server Configuration.

#### Viewing Logs

MCP clients handle logs generated by the service. Different MCP clients may store logs in different locations:

- For Claude Desktop: Check Claude Desktop application logs
- For Cursor: Check Cursor's MCP logs section
- For other clients: Refer to the client's documentation on how to access MCP service logs
