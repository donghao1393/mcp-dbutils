# Development Guide

## Code Quality

### Quality Gates
We use SonarCloud to maintain high code quality standards. All pull requests must pass the following quality gates:

- Code Coverage: â‰¥ 80%
- Code Quality:
  * No blocking or critical issues
  * Fewer than 10 major issues
  * Code duplication < 3%
- Security:
  * No security vulnerabilities
  * No security hotspots

### Automated Checks
Our CI/CD pipeline automatically performs:
1. Complete test suite execution
2. Code coverage analysis
3. SonarCloud static code analysis
4. Quality gate validation

Pull requests that don't meet these standards will automatically be blocked from merging.

### Code Style
We use Ruff for code style checking and formatting:

All code must follow our style guide:
- Line length: 88 characters
- Indentation: 4 spaces
- Quotes: Double quotes
- Naming: PEP8 conventions

For detailed guidelines, see [STYLE_GUIDE.md](../../../docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md).

### Local Development
To check code quality locally:
1. Run tests with coverage:
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=src/mcp_dbutils --cov-report=xml:coverage.xml tests/
   ```
2. Use SonarLint in your IDE to catch issues early
3. View SonarCloud analysis in PR comments
4. Run Ruff for code style checking:
   ```bash
   # Install Ruff
   uv pip install ruff

   # Check code style
   ruff check .

   # Format code
   ruff format .
   ```
5. Use pre-commit hooks for automatic checks:
   ```bash
   # Install pre-commit
   uv pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```
